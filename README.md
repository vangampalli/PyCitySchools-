# PyCitySchools-

In this project data from 15 school districts are given to us. In order to make meaningul observations from the data, we organized it into different dataframes. These dataframes are further grouped and binned based on different variables to understand how things like population size or money spent per student affect the students' scores. This exercise relies on the Pandas library.
